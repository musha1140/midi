# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest version of the project is supported with security updates. Ensure you are always using the latest version.
The latest version is not supported for public use for security reasons. THe Midi file sources are not supported to be used in the public domain (though legally, it is fine to use MIDI files in the public domain, the bandwidth of the midi file is not supported on my current budget for open use)
Instead a replacement midi file website downloader will be included.
